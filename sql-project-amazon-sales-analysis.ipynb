It captures essential details related to orders, including fulfillment methods, product categories, shipping details, and financial data. This dataset is valuable for analyzing sales performance, understanding customer behavior, and assessing the efficiency of fulfillment processes.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Columns:**\n1.  **Order_ID**: A unique identifier for each order, used to track and differentiate transactions.\n1.  **Date**: The date when the order was placed, formatted as YY-MM-DD. This allows for time-based analysis, such as trends in sales over time or the impact of specific dates on sales volumes.\n1.  **Status**:  Indicates the current state of the order.Common statuses include \n     *     **Shipped:** The order has been dispatched.\n     *     **Cancelled:** The order was cancelled and not processed further.\n     *     **Delivered:** The order has been delivered to the customer.\n1.  **Fulfilment**: Specifies whether the order was fulfilled by Amazon or by a third-party Merchant. This column helps in assessing the efficiency and reliability of different fulfillment methods. \n1.  **Sales_Channel**: The platform or channel through which the sale was made (e.g., Amazon.in). This information is useful for analyzing the performance of different sales channels  \n1.  **ship_service_level**: The level of shipping service selected for the order, such as **Standard** or **Expedited**. This can be analyzed to understand customer preferences for shipping speed.\n1.  **Category**: The product category to which the ordered item belongs, such as **T-shirt**, **Shirt**, or **Blazzer**. This helps in identifying which product categories are most popular among customers.\n1.  **Size**: The size of the product, which is particularly relevant for apparel items. Understanding size distribution can inform inventory decisions and customer preferences.\n1.  **Courier Status**: The current status of the shipment, such as **On the Way** or **Shipped**. This column provides insight into the shipping process and potential delays.\n1.  **Qty**: The quantity of items ordered in a particular transaction. This is useful for calculating total units sold and understanding order patterns.\n1.  **Amount**: The total monetary value of the order. This column is critical for revenue analysis and calculating metrics like total sales and average order value.\n1.  **ship_city**: The city to which the order was shipped. Analyzing sales by city can reveal geographic trends and hotspots for customer activity.\n1.  **ship_state**: The state to which the order was shipped. This column is key for regional analysis, helping to identify which states contribute most to sales and where marketing efforts could be focused\n1.  **ship_postal-code**: The postal code of the shipping address, which can be used for more granular geographic analysis.\n\n\n\n**Potential Uses:**\n\n* **Sales Performance Analysis**: Measure total sales, average order values, and trends over time.\n* **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Understand customer preferences based on product categories, sizes, and shipping methods.\n* **Operational Efficiency**: Evaluate the performance of different fulfillment methods and shipping services.\n* **Geographic Insights**: Identify high-performing regions and potential markets for expansion.\n\nThis dataset serves as a robust foundation for various types of analysis, providing insights that can help improve sales strategies, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency on the Amazon platform.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data cleaning\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* **Handling duplicates**: As Order_id column is unique indetifier for each order so we will be checking for this column.

By leveraging the KPIs and further analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n**1. Overall Sales Performance:**\n*     The **Total Sales Amount of 7,33,23,468.87 rupees** indicates robust revenue generation, reflecting a healthy volume of transactions. Monitoring this metric over time can help in identifying periods of peak sales activity and understanding the factors driving these results.\n\n* The **Average Order Value (AOV) of 609.87 rupees** provides a clear picture of customer spending behavior. A consistent or increasing AOV suggests effective pricing strategies and customer willingness to purchase higher-value items or bundles.\n\n**2. Customer and Order Behavior:**\n*     A total of **1,20,229 units** unique orders were processed, as reflected in the **Number of Orders** metric. This volume shows consistent customer engagement and order flow.\n\n* The **Order Status Breakdown** revealed that **66.50%** of orders were **successfully shipped**, **4.63%** were **cancelled**, and **22.06%** were **delivered**. The relatively low cancellation rate suggests strong inventory management and customer satisfaction.\n\n**3. Regional Sales Insights:**\n*     The **Sales by Region (State)** analysis identified that the state of **Maharashtra** contributed **124,40,118.52rupees** in sales, representing **16.97%** of total sales. This makes it the top-performing region, indicating a potential focus area for targeted marketing and logistics efforts.\n    \n*     Other high-performing states, such as **Karnataka** and **Uttar Pradesh**, also showed significant contributions, with sales amounting to **98,17,768.1rupees** and **64,37,670.88rupees**, respectively. These insights are vital for regional strategy development.\n\n**4. Fulfillment and Shipping:**\n*     The **Order Fulfillment Rate** analysis showed that **69.79%** of orders were fulfilled by **Amazon**, while **30.21%** were fulfilled by **third-party merchants**. This split indicates a balanced approach to order fulfillment, with Amazon maintaining a strong role in ensuring timely deliveries.\n\n**5. Sales Trends Over Time:**\n*     The **Sales Trends Over Time** analysis showed peak sales periods in **April**, with total monthly sales reaching **258,86,087rupees**. Identifying these trends helps in preparing for high-demand periods, ensuring adequate inventory and staffing+\n\n**6. Operational Efficiency:**\n*     The **Cancelled Orders Rate** was found to be **4.63%**, which is relatively low and indicates effective order processing and customer satisfaction. Reducing this rate further could lead to even higher customer retention and revenue stability.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Final Recommendations","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Given these insights, the following strategic actions are recommended:\n\n* **Focus on High-Performing Regions:** Enhance marketing and logistics operations in top-performing states like **Maharashtra,** **Karnataka**, and **Uttar Pradesh** to drive further growth in these areas.\n\n* **Optimize Fulfillment Processes:** Continue to improve fulfillment operations to maintain and potentially increase the proportion of Amazon-fulfilled orders, ensuring timely and reliable deliveries.\n\n* **Capitalize on Seasonal Trends:** Use the identified sales trends to anticipate demand spikes during peak periods, allowing for better inventory management and staffing adjustments.\n\n* **Leverage Shipping Preferences:** Tailor shipping options based on customer preferences, offering promotions for faster shipping services where there is clear demand.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the company can maintain its competitive edge, improve customer satisfaction, and drive sustained growth. Regular monitoring of these periodic deeper analysis will be essential to adapting to market changes and seizing new opportunities.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Thankyou for reading my first SQL project , I appreciate it!**","metadata":{}}]}
